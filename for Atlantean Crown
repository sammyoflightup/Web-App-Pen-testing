## Project Overview

**Target**: Atlantean Crown Web Application  
**Testing Dates**: March, 2025  
**Tester**: Samuel George (Lightup Defence )

### Objective:
The purpose of this penetration test was to assess the security of the Atlantean Crown web application, focusing on identifying potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.

### Scope:
The test covered all publicly accessible web endpoints, including:
- Authentication mechanisms
- User data storage
- API endpoints
- Third-party integrations

### Methodology:
A combination of automated and manual testing techniques were used to identify security issues such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), authentication flaws, and insecure server configurations.

## Vulnerability Scanning

### Vulnerability Scan Results

**Scanning Tool**: Burp Suite

1. **Vulnerability**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
   **Description**: Reflected XSS vulnerability in the login form.  
   **Severity**: High  
   **Evidence**: [Insert evidence and payloads]

2. **Vulnerability**: SQL Injection  
   **Description**: Blind SQL Injection detected in the search functionality.  
   **Severity**: Critical  
   **Evidence**: [Insert evidence]

## Exploitation

### Exploit Report

1. **Exploit**: Reflected XSS

   **Description**: Successfully executed a payload on the login form that triggered a pop-up, indicating a reflected XSS vulnerability.

   **Impact**: An attacker could steal user sessions or perform actions on behalf of the victim.



---

## Recommendations

1. **XSS Vulnerability**  
   **Recommendation**: Implement proper output encoding and use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS.

2. **SQL Injection**  
   **Recommendation**: Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

## Follow-up Testing

### Retesting Results

1. **Test**: Reflected XSS  
   **Status**: Fixed.  
   **Description**: The XSS vulnerability was mitigated by implementing input sanitization.

2. **Test**: SQL Injection  
   **Status**: Fixed.  
   **Description**: The SQL injection vulnerability was addressed by using prepared statements.
